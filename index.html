                <blockquote><h4>A Great Man</h4><p>Though I did not know Mr.Jobs personally, his innovation and passion for striving for a better tomorrow fueled my own technological endeavors. My once PC fanboy mentality found a new path because of the quality of his work and ambition to make a better product. Apple, will never be the same without any of his input on products and he will be sorely missed, PC owner or not. RIP Steve Jobs.</p><cite>Bayard</cite></blockquote>
